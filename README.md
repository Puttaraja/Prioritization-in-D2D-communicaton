# Prioritization in D2D communication

Sharding or clustering of D2D users based on application type for better resource allocation for the public safety devices. 

K - means algorithm is used for clustering.

Results are verified by calculating
SINR, Through- put and end to end delay of all the shards/clusters which are created.
